## Current Status

**Active Phase**: Phase 6 (Testing & Polish) - **CPU accuracy testing complete!**

**Next Milestone**: Test commercial ROMs with accuracy-verified CPU

**Major Achievement**: All 3 Blargg CPU test ROMs pass after fixing 3 critical bugs:

1. **CB Register Encoding**: CB instructions use different register mapping (0=B,1=C,2=D,3=E,4=H,5=L,6=(HL),7=A instead of 0=A,1=B,...). Created `get_reg_cb()` and `set_reg_cb()` helpers. Test 01 went from 31K to 1.26M matching instructions.

2. **Interrupt Timing**: Moved interrupt check from BEFORE to AFTER instruction execution, ensuring interrupts triggered during instruction execution (like writing to IF) are serviced immediately.

3. **Timer Frequencies**: Corrected timer frequencies from T-cycles to M-cycles (DIV: 64 M-cycles, TAC frequencies: 256/4/16/64 M-cycles). Test 02 now passes.

**Test Results**:
- ✅ 01-special.gb: **Passed** (1,256,633 instructions match Gameboy Doctor reference)
- ✅ 02-interrupts.gb: **Passed**
- ✅ 03-op_sp_hl.gb: **Passed**

**Recent Completion**:

- All 512 CPU instructions (256 base + 256 CB-prefixed) with proper flag handling and cycle-accurate timing
- PPU framework with complete pixel fetcher, FIFO, background tile rendering, and VBlank interrupt
- Complete interrupt system with priority handling for all 5 interrupt types
- STAT interrupts for PPU mode changes (HBlank, VBlank, OAM Search)
- Timer system with DIV, TIMA, TMA, TAC registers and 4 frequency modes
- Main emulation loop implemented and integrated
- SDL2 bundled build completed (2m 29s compilation time)
- **Project successfully compiles and links** - 421KB release binary ready
- **Emulator is feature-complete** and ready for testing with ROMs
- VS Code tasks.json with build/run/test configurations
- Comprehensive testing documentation in refs/TESTING.md
- **Clippy clean** (0 warnings) with all auto-fixes applied
- **MBC1 memory bank controller** implemented with ROM/RAM banking
- **PPU FIFO deadlock fixed** - changed condition from len>8 to !empty
- **LCDC/BGP/STAT registers initialized** - LCD enabled, background on, STAT mode tracking
- **Test ROM verified** - halt_bug.gb displays text correctly
- **OAM DMA implemented** - 0xFF46 register triggers 160-byte transfer in 160 M-cycles
- **HALT wake-up fixed** - CPU wakes on any enabled+pending interrupt even if IME=0
- **DIV register reset** - writing to 0xFF04 properly resets it to 0
- **STAT interrupts implemented** - Mode 0/1/2 interrupts trigger based on STAT enable bits
- Published v0.1.0 to GitHub
- All debugging features committed and pushed
